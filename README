This repository is for toy projects related to my learning C++ and Haskell.

Here is a list of the projects and what they hope to accomplish:

game_of_life:

Simulates Conway's Game of Life. Currently, it is set for a 40x40 game board, and the input is a .txt file consisting of 0 and 1. I would like to add a graphical interface. Should be easy.
